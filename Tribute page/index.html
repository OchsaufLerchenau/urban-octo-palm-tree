            <ul class="content">

                <li>Krzysztof Eugeniusz Penderecki (Polish: [ˈkʂɨʂtɔf pɛndɛˈrɛt͡skʲi]; 
                    23 November 1933 – 29 March 2020) was a Polish composer and conductor. 
                    Among his best known works are Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima, 
                    Symphony No. 3, his St. Luke Passion, Polish Requiem, Anaklasis and 
                    Utrenja. Penderecki composed four operas, eight symphonies and other 
                    orchestral pieces, a variety of instrumental concertos, choral 
                    settings of mainly religious texts, as well as chamber and 
                    instrumental works.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Born in Dębica to a lawyer, Penderecki studied music at Jagiellonian 
                    University and the Academy of Music in Kraków. After graduating from 
                    the Academy, he became a teacher there and began his career as a 
                    composer in 1959 during the Warsaw Autumn festival. His Threnody to 
                    the Victims of Hiroshima for string orchestra and the choral work St. 
                    e Passion have received popular acclaim. His first opera, The Devils 
                    of Loudun, was not immediately successful. Beginning in the mid-1970s,
                    nderecki's composing style changed, with his first violin concerto 
                    focusing on the semitone and the tritone. His choral work Polish 
                    Requiem was written in the 1980s and expanded in 1993 and 2005. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Penderecki won many prestigious awards, including the Prix Italia in 
                    1967 and 1968, four Grammy Awards in 1987, 1998 (twice), and 2017, 
                    the Wolf Prize in Arts in 1987 and the University of Louisville 
                    Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition in 1992.[2] In 2012, Sean 
                    Michaels of The Guardian called him "arguably Poland's greatest 
                    living composer".
